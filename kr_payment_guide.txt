Please see this file as a *guide* for KR payments around changes within Krunkerâ€™s language files. For simplicity, we will work based on pull requests (PR).

If there are multiple pull requests fixing existing issues from the same person, pull requests may be aggregated together to prevent abuse of payments.

KR will be sent to the user submitting the pull request, unless pre-arranged (ie. KR is being split between players based on work breakdowns).

Account verification is typically reserved for new translations where one or two people have solemnly worked on a pre-approved translation, providing quality work with little to no errors during the review process.

Account verification is also reserved for users who continuously contribute to the Translation project while providing quality work with little to no errors during the review process and assist others when help is required.

Regular contributors will more than likely receive the middle to upper end of the KR payments when demonstrating similar qualities as what is reserved for Account verification users.

Changes to payments may be made at any point in time where required.

Abuse of this payment system will not be tolerated.
