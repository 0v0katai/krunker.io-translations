Please see this file as a *guide* for KR payments around changes within Krunkerâ€™s language files. For simplicity, we will work based on pull requests (PR).

If there are multiple pull requests fixing existing issues from the same person, pull requests may be aggregated together to prevent abuse of payments.

KR will be sent to the user submitting the pull request, unless pre-arranged (ie. KR is being split between players based on work breakdowns).

Changes to payments may be made at any point in time where required.

Abuse of this payment system will not be tolerated.
