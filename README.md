Missing content/translations
------
All of the items are in a key:value format, and from time to time Krunker developers will update en.js and not other language files (as they're native English speakers).

You can see what key:values (read: language content) is missing by running this script: check_for_missing_content_keys.sh

This will omit files in the format of "<lang>_MISSING_KEYS.txt". Feel free to cherry pick the items based on the language you know, and enter it into your respective "<lang>.js" file.

This script will also be frequently run, and at a glance..you'll be able to see what is missing by checking: SUMMARY_MISSING_KEYS.txt

If you do translate any missing content, please make sure that the missing keys are placed within their respective positions within the file (eg. check for the location within en.js)
