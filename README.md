All of the items are in a key:value format, and from time to time Krunker developers will update en.js and not other language files (as they're native English speakers).

You can see what key:values (read: language content) is missing by running this script: check_for_missing_content_keys.sh

This will omit files in the format of "<lang>_MISSING_KEYS.txt". Feel free to cherry pick the items based on the language you know, and enter it into your respective "<lang>.js" file.

This script will also be frequently run, and at a glance..you'll be able to see what is missing by checking: STATS_MISSING_KEYS.txt
